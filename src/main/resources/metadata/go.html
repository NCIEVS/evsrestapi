Gene Ontology (GO) is a collaborative effort with the aim of standardizing the representation of gene and gene product attributes across species and databases. GO covers three main subject areas: molecular function, biological process, and cellular component. GO does not name genes or gene products, nor does it attempt to provide structured terminology beyond its three domains.

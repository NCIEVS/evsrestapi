Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) is provided by the European Bioinformatics Institute, which is part of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, located on the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus in Hinxton, UK. ChEBI is a freely available dictionary of molecular entities focused on 'small' chemical compounds and also specifies the relationships between molecular entities or classes of entities. The term 'molecular entity' refers to any constitutionally or isotopically distinct atom, molecule, ion, ion pair, radical, radical ion, complex, conformer, etc., identifiable as a separately distinguishable entity. The molecular entities represented are either natural or synthetic products that are used to intervene in the processes of living organisms. Most molecules directly encoded by the genome (e.g. nucleic acids, proteins and cleavage-derived peptides) are not included in ChEBI. Data is incorporated from several sources and subjected to merging procedures to eliminate redundancy. The main data sources are IntEnz, KEGG COMPOUND, PDBeChem, and ChEMBL. Data from several other sources are manually entered into the database by a ChEBI curator.
